<strong>Project Title: Inventory Management App</strong>

<strong>Description:</strong>

I developed an Inventory Management App designed for an imaginary store to practice and reinforce my skills in full-stack development. This application enables users to manage various categories and items within an inventory, supporting all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It provides a comprehensive system to handle product data efficiently.

<strong>Technologies Used:</strong>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Express.js:</strong> For server-side logic and routing.</li>
  <li><strong>MongoDB:</strong> For database management and data storage.</li>
  <li><strong>Node.js:</strong> As the runtime environment for executing JavaScript server-side.</li>
  <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> For client-side and server-side scripting.</li>
  <li><strong>HTML/CSS:</strong> For structuring and styling the web pages.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Features:</strong>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Category Management:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Create:</strong> Add new categories to the inventory.</li>
      <li><strong>Read:</strong> View a list of all categories.</li>
      <li><strong>Update:</strong> Modify existing category details.</li>
      <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Remove categories from the inventory, with automatic removal of associated items.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Item Management:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Create:</strong> Add new items under specific categories.</li>
      <li><strong>Read:</strong> View details of items and filter them by category.</li>
      <li><strong>Update:</strong> Edit item details such as price, quantity, and name.</li>
      <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Remove items from the inventory.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>User Interface:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Read Views:</strong> Display categories and items in a user-friendly manner.</li>
      <li><strong>Forms:</strong> For creating and updating categories and items.</li>
      <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Ensure the application is functional and visually appealing across different devices.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Data Integrity:</strong> Implemented logic to handle the deletion of categories, ensuring associated items are also removed to maintain data consistency.</li>
  <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Deployed the application to a cloud platform, making it accessible online for users.</li>
</ul>
